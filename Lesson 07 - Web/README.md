⚙️ Three “layers” of the web:
Surface Web: The normal internet — Google, YouTube, Wikipedia. Search engines can find it.

Deep Web: Pages not indexed by search engines — like emails, private databases, or school portals. (Most of what we use daily is actually part of the deep web — just private.)

Dark Web: A small part of the deep web that’s intentionally hidden. You need special browsers like Tor to access .onion sites. It’s used for:

✅ Privacy, activism, journalism in restricted countries

❌ Illegal activity (drugs, stolen data, etc.)

⚠️ Important note:

The dark web isn’t always illegal — it’s just hidden.
But it’s not safe for casual browsing — lots of scams, malware, and shady stuff.
Never access it unless you really know what you’re doing and have a reason (like cybersecurity research).
